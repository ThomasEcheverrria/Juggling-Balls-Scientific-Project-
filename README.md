# Juggling-Balls-Scientific-Project-
Create automatic lightning balls

The project is very simle. We insert a GPS module into jugglning balls and we get all the information for using it. We use that data twice, first we change the color of the LED into the balls (when the ball accelerates the LED is red, when it decelerates the LED is blue and when it is stable the LED is green).

The second use of the data is in an Android app. We try to get ball's data with a Bluetooth connection and we draw the ball into the android app, using GPS parameters.
